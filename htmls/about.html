                    <p>The Reality Shares Guard Indicator, a proprietary system designed to measure overall market
                        strength,
                        recently shifted to indicate a positive market environment. After 232 days in the red, this
                        shift
                        towards strong markets could bode well for investors.<br><br>
                        The Energy sector played a key role in the upswing as its Guard Score became positive this week
                        as
                        well. It is now the eighth S&P sector with a positive Guard Score. The Guard Indicator
                        calculates
                        Guard Scores for each of the ten S&P 500 sectors by factoring in downside deviation, price
                        momentum
                        and
                        volatility. When eight or more of the sectors have a positive Guard Score, the Guard Indicator
                        forecasts a broad market upswing. When seven or fewer of the sectors however have positive Guard
                        Score, the
                        Guard Indicator points toward possible market weakness.<br><br>
                        One ETF, the Reality Shares DIVCON Dividend Guard ETF (Ticker: GARD), utilizes the Guard
                        Indicator
                        to time a dynamic short component. The GARD ETF removed its short hedge on May 6, 2016, and is
                        now
                        long-only in the healthiest dividend paying companies on the market (as determined by the DIVCON
                        dividend health rating system).<br><br>
                        The GARD ETF attempts to dynamically and systematically predict future dividend changes and
                        overall
                        market health using DIVCON, a proprietary forward-looking dividend growth-related rating system.
                        It
                        evaluates seven company health indicators rather than looking at past dividend changes. The ETF
                        invests in the large-cap companies most likely to increase their dividend based on the highest
                        DIVCON scores. When the Guard Indicator predicts a market downturn, the ETF dynamically reduces
                        long
                        exposure to 50% while adding a 50% short position in the lowest DIVCON-rated companies – those
                        most likely to cut dividends.<br><br>
                        The GARD ETF seeks to systematically break down the building blocks behind some of the best
                        actively
                        managed funds and helps provide institutional-quality security selection and risk budgeting –
                        offering a potentially attractive and intelligent investment product for dividend growth ETF
                        investors.
