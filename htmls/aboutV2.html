                    <h4>Access the future of dividend growth</h4>
                    <p>At Reality Shares, we are solely focused on dividend growth investing. From our rigorous research
                        process to the development of indices, dividend rankings and market indicators, everything we do
                        is
                        dedicated to analyzing and delivering new dividend growth opportunities to investors and their
                        advisors.<br><br>
                        Founded in 2012, Reality Shares began when a group of entrepreneurial industry veterans came
                        together with a pioneering purpose: to take institutional-quality dividend growth strategies and
                        deliver
                        them to the masses. We recognized dividend growth as a means of cutting through the noise in the
                        markets and investing in the true health of a company—investing in reality. Our team developed a
                        series
                        of powerful models that isolate, analyze, assess and predict dividend growth potential. Today,
                        our
                        rules-based, forward-looking methodology sets us apart in the market and through our ETFs,
                        allows
                        investors to access and harness the real power of dividend growth investing.
                        <br><br>We offer a range of ETFs that pinpoint and capitalize on investment in dividend growth
                        and
                        the
                        stocks
                        that are most likely to increase their dividends, as well as avoiding those that are more likely
                        to cut their
                        dividends. Our proprietary DIVCON scoring system systematically ranks companies’ future dividend
                        growth prospects based on a weight average of seven quality factors that are correlated to
                        dividend
                        growth.</p>
